The Far Shore Inn is a medieval fantasy Discord [rp](/seeds/Roleplay) server.
Themes include
slice-of-life, adventure, action, horror, and fantasy. The big idea is that
the story takes place on an island. Access to the island is restricted and
shrouded in mystery - imagine something like the disappearances in the Bermuda
Triangle.
