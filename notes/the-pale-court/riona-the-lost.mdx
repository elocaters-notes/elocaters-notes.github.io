Riona is a Sylvari character I created for
[The Pale Court](/the-pale-court/) setting.

## Summary of Events so Far

1. Riona met another Sylvari named Callaoife. Callaoife lied to Riona about her
   name and her intentions. After meeting, Callaoife poisoned her and hunted
   her and has since whisked her away to The Pale Court. Riona has mixed
   feelings about Callaoife despite the betrayals and injuries.

2. Riona met a Sylvari man named Lilefynn while imprisoned. He was kind to her,
   but refused to let her free from the cell. Lilefynn gave her a pillow, a
   drink, and a meal.
