    To erase false perceptions, tell yourself: I have it in me to keep my soul
    from evil, desire, and all confusion. To see things as they are and treat
    them as they deserve.

    Don't overlook this innate ability.

Clarity of mind.

For the past two days, the entire Order has engaged in a pitched battle, not with some external enemy but with ourselves. We struggled within ourselves over the actions and words of a child. We allowed ourselves to be goaded into words and behavior as petulant as the one on trial. Most shameful of all was on the first day when the Knights devolved into bickering over Alcera, who wasn't even present. This child did not sew discord between our ranks; he revealed it for all to see. The fault is with us.

I will seek to build a bridge to Alcera and mend this rift.

And when the weight of false impressions, the crush of everyday life, becomes too much to bear, I will remember this mantra:

"I have the power to keep that out. I can see the Truth."
