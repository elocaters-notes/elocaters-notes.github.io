Seeds are posts about single ideas. They are not restricted to any single
roleplay universe. Many of the seed posts are effectively just definitions for
terms, but they're more than just a glossary. The term comes from the idea of
a [Digital Garden](/seeds/digital-garden). As such, seeds are building blocks for
bigger ideas, by linking them together seeds can grow into full blown ideas.

Also, yes, this description of what seeds are, is itself a seed.
