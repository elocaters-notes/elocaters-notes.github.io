title: "Spell Reference - Elder Scrolls RP"

The Elder Scrolls uses a [soft magic system](/seeds/soft-magic). As such, I
frequently find myself needing to write down spells and abilities to use as
reference. What follows is a simple form I try to use when describing spells
as guidance for how to write with magic.

  ### Description

  A plaintext description of the spell's effects. Try to focus on how the
  player will write the effect and on how other members of the scene might
  percieve it.
