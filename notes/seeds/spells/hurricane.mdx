### Description

Winds swirl and coil around the character, twisting into a tiny malestrom with
them at the center. Nearby creatures are buffeted by the air, though not
actually hurt by it. Attacks and projectiles aimed at the character can be
deflected by the strong winds. The effect can be disorienting for enemies in
melee range and can make it hard to consistently hit the character.

This spell requires magicka for as long as it's maintained. As such, it will be
hard for even a skilled mage to maintain this spell while also using other
spells.
