Seeds are posts about single ideas. They are not restricted to any single
roleplay universe. Many seeds are effectively just definitions for
terms, but they're more than a mere glossary. The term comes from the idea of
a [Digital Garden](/seeds/digital-garden). As such, seeds are building blocks
for bigger ideas, by linking them together seeds can grow into full blown
ideas!
