I have to look up month names every time I write a journal entry or otherwise
reference dates and times in the Elder Scrolls. So this is just a copy of
in-universe month names and their corresponding names on the
[Gregorian calendar](/seeds/calendar/gregorian-calendar).

1. [Morning Star - January](/seeds/calendar/january)
2. [Sun's Dawn - February](/seeds/calendar/february)
3. [First Seed - March](/seeds/calendar/march)
4. [Rain's Hand - April](/seeds/calendar/april)
5. [Second Seed - May](/seeds/calendar/may)
6. [Mid Year - June](/seeds/calendar/june)
7. [Sun's Height - July](/seeds/calendar/july)
8. [Last Seed - August](/seeds/calendar/august)
9. [Hearthfire - September](/seeds/calendar/september)
10. [Frost Fall - October](/seeds/calendar/october)
11. [Sun's Dusk - November](/seeds/calendar/november)
12. [Evening Star - December](/seeds/calendar/december)
