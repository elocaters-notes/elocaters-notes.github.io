    Will, lost in a sea of trouble, <br />
    rise, save yourself from the whirlpool <br />
    of the enemies of willing. <br />
    Courage exposes ambushes. <br />
    Steadfastness destroys enemies. <br />
    Keep your victories hidden. <br />
    Do not sulk over defeat. <br />
    Accept good. Bend before evil. <br />
    Learn the rhythm which binds all men. <br />
