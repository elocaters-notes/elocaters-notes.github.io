Late that night, beneath the moon and the stars, Regina sits in silence atop the far battlements of Blackpool Keep. A gentle midnight breeze toys with her hair, tossing it to reflect the moonlight with an iridescent crimson hue. Impassive as a statue, not even the subtle movement of breath disturbs her vigil of the lake far below.

"I'm going to do it."

She breaks the silence with soft words, barely audible above the lapping waves.

"But you cannot join me."

Her hand closes over the hilt of her sword, lifting it to consider the ruddy brown blade. Meteoric Iron made for such a curious edge; the starlight seemed to pool in the delicate tracery along its length, only to reflect again to form a shifting pattern of light on her face.

"Martin has explained- has shown me- that to accept means more than just a title. That it'd mean carrying the safety of the others on my shoulders as he does. I know what that is. I've done it before. I've born you."

The air around the blade shimmers like hot air over magma—a familiar sight for someone who grew up among the ashes to the south. Her grip tightens on the hilt as a cherry red glow blossoms from deep within the metal.

"What does a person do when faced with an obstacle they cannot overcome by just means alone? Does she accept injustice to defeat it? Or allow herself to be crushed beneath its weight?"

Regina grabs the naked blade with her left hand, wincing at the burn. The sword continues to heat until the length of metal blazes with a glorious white light, illuminating the entire battlement around her.

"Their fight is our fight! The Matron's cause is our cause! We would be doing good together!"

She trembles, hunched over the blade, as the metallic patterns brand themselves into the palm of her left hand. Her pupils contract to scant pinpricks against the radiant light, blinded against the dark of night around them. All she could see was the light that illuminated her and the sword.

"You... do not understand... because you cannot understand..."

Regina tears her hand away from the raging metal, wincing as burned skin cracks with the movement. In one hand, she lifts the sword overhead -- its length a bar of white light against the dark sky.

"But you deserve peace anyways. Peace that you will never have if I carry you as a Knight. Peace that you can still have.."

With all her vampiric strength, Regina throws the sword high across the lake. It tumbles end-over-end through the air, flashing with undiminished radiance as it soars. Her sword plummets into the water amidst a plume of steam, dropping from the sky like a falling star.

She looks out across the water, holding her branded left hand gingerly against her chest, watching as the night becomes still once more.

And so it came to pass that an claíomh solais -- a sword forged from a fragment of Atherius itself; a sword holding a shard of a mortal soul; a sword which held the Regina-that-was -- found rest beneath the waves before Blackpool Keep.

"I'll have to ask Martin for a sword."
