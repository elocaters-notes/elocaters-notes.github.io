The Far Shore Inn is a medieval fantasy Discord [rp](/seeds/roleplay) server.
Themes include slice-of-life, adventure, action, horror, and fantasy. The big
idea is that the story takes place on an island. Access to the island is
restricted and shrouded in mystery - imagine something like the disappearances
in the Bermuda Triangle.
