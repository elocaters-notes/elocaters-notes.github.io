The term Digital Garden is not well-defined. The big idea is that it refers to
a digital space that favors growth, creativity, and communication over the
creation of finalized products. You can imagine "growing" ideas from singular
seeds into trees, plants, and forests of knowledge by linking ideas together.

I stumbled into some neat resources about this recentlyâ€”namely, this
[brief history of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).
I also like this
[example of a digital garden](https://enjoyment-work.netlify.app/) created with
Jekyll.
