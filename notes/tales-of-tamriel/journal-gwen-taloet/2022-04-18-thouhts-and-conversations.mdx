Lately, I have been meditating on a quote from the Book of Circles.

<Quote

  "The sword is the self. Its edge is the mind."
</Quote>

I never understood this phrase as well as I do now. The gods do not ask of us more than we can give. The curse they've placed upon me isn't a punishment; it's a necessity. I have spent a lifetime training and mastering my self-discipline. I'm not simply a woman - I am the sword. By placing the curse upon me instead of another, my enemies haven't created a new ally - as they wished - they've created a foe they are not prepared to fight.

Yesterday I spoke with Malyani about our curse and how we should reveal it. Indeed, I think Kireth deserves to know. She's already suspicious - and rightfully so - because we were not affected by that cursed pike. Lying to her feels wrong, not only because it's a lie! She's such an earnest soul. I still remember how touched she seemed when I offered to let her share my room at the Inn.

It's funny, though; Malyani said she found me inspirational when we spoke. It's such a kind thing to say, but the truth of the matter is I would never have found myself again without her help. And now, I never feel as relaxed or at ease as I do when we talk. The inspiration comes from her, and I'm glad that I can return it in kind.
