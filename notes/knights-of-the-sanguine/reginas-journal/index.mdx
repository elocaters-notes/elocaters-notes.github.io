[Regina's](/knights-of-the-sanguine/regina-profile) journal is an unassuming
brown book. The cover bears her name in small letters near the top, while the
front face contains a short line of poetry:

<Quote>
  The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, <br />
  Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit <br />
  Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, <br />
  Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. <br />
</Quote>

Inside are an odd mix of loose papers and affixed pages. The loose pages appear to be from another book - written in another hand - while the secured pages are in Regina's own handwriting. She often quotes the pages in her entires.
