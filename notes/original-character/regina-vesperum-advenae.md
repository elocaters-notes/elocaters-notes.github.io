Regina is an [original character](/original-character/) I created for
[RP](/seeds/roleplay) in ESO.
She's participated in multiple settings but there are a few principles I keep
to regardless of the setting.

## Background

- Born in Narsis (Western Deshaan)
- Had a close relationship with her grandfather
- Her immediate family died when she was a young-adult (instigates whatever
  adventures follows)
- She is athiest/irreverent. She does not pray to the Tribunal or believe in
  their divinity
- Stoic.
