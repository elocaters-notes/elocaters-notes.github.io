The Elder Scrolls setting allows for a ton of variability in how Vampirism
works. This note just captures some of the relevant highlights for my character
in the current chapter.

- Some vampires ([Gwen](/tales-of-tamriel/gwen-taloet) included) cannot eat
  conventional food without getting sick
- Vampires are not negatively affected by the sun (at least in any appreciable
  way)
- Blood Scions exist, but they are born only through physical harm and a
  semi-normal transmission. (none of the more questionable parts of the lore
  here)
