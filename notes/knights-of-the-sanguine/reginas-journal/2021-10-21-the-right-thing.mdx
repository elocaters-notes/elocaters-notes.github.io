  Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn't matter. <br />
  Cold or warm. <br />
  Tired or well-rested. <br />
  Despised or honored. <br />
  Dying... or busy with other assignments. <br />
  <br />
  Because dying, too, is one of our assignments in life. There as well: "to do what needs doing." <br />

What was he thinking when he wrote this? I've always wondered if he knew the
plague was terminal.

I met a man recently, named Dejnar.

He told me that I am already dead. But if dying is my last assignment in this
world, then what does it mean that I've already finished?

It doesn't say "last", only "one of".

.

Today, I will search for what needs doing.
