### Description

Magicka shimmers around the character as they fall through the air. The
immediate effect is that they slow to a safe rate of descent. There needs to
be enough time for the spell to safely slow the character for this to do any
good. When the character lands, they alight on their feet as if having only
fallen as short distance.

This spell can be used on other people, but they need to be within sight of the
caster.

The spell consumes magicka for the entire duration of its use. It would be hard
for a mage to maintain this while also using other spells.
