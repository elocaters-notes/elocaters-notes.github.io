## General Info

- **Name:** Mella Liadon
- **Gender/Pronouns:** She/Her
- **Race:** Elf
- **Birthplace:** Off Island
- **Stage of Life:** Adult

## Appearance

- **Age:** early twenties
- **Height:** 5'0''
- **Weight:** 95lb
- **Hair:** Brown
- **Skin:** Light Tan
- **Eyes:** Hazel
- **Distinguishing Marks:** None! No scars, no tattoos, just Mella
- **Usual Clothing:** Normal clothing (not armor). Trousers and a shirt, or she'll wear a skirt if she has one. She'll generally wear anything she can move around it easily (Mella never stops moving).

## Personality

- **Behavior:** Mella is usually an overflowing fountain of happiness. She can be relentlessly cheerful and full of energy. At the same time, when things crash, they *really* crash, and she becomes devastatingly unhappy. There's rarely a day when Mella's just "good"; she's always having either the best day of her life or the worst.
- **Demeanor:** Extraverted, excitable, high-strung, empathetic
- **Likes:** Hunting, Flowers, Anything Sweet, Books
- **Dislikes:** Raised voices, open expressions of anger, strong bad smells
- **Moral/Ethical Beliefs:** Mella *tries* to be good but often finds herself in bad situations. She's generally empathetic and mostly adheres to "treat others the way you'd like to be treated."
- **Hobbies:** Calligraphy, Reading, Carving (poorly), Math
- **Quirks:** Mella seldom stops moving - not unless she's sleeping. Even then, it's not a guarantee because she sleepwalks sometimes. It's not nervous energy; it's more like she's so full of energy that she simply cannot bear to sit still.
- **Fears:** vampires, being abandoned
- **Manias:** Mella is almost magnetically attracted to sadism. *She* is not sadistic, but if someone around her *is* she'll almost inevitably end up in their orbit.

## Possessions

- **Owns:** Almost nothing! She arrived on the island with nothing but the clothes on her back!
- **Backpack:** N/A
- **Pockets:** A small notebook, a few bits of compressed charcoal for writing
- **Equipment:** A small knife in a leather sheath.

## Abilities

- **Fighting style:** Bad. Mella has basically no discipline when it comes to fighting. She hasn't been trained and doesn't know much about how to fight correctly. Since becoming a Werewolf, she's always relied on the fact that she can always transform when things get *really* bad.
- **Skills:**
  - Calligraphy
  - Writing in general
  - copying documents and forging handwriting
  - Bookkeeping/Accounting

## Weaknesses

- Fighting!
- Easily intimidated and frightened

## Biography

Mella spent her childhood learning the ins and outs of her parent's trading company.
The experience was generally *good* by most measures, but she found the expectations
stifling. Mella ran away from home in her late teens. While on the run, she was attacked
by a werewolf and contracted lycanthropy. By a stroke of luck, she fell in with a
friendly group of similarly-effected people who helped her get enough control to live
with her condition.
