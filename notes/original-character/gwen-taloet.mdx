Gwen is an [original character](/original-character/) I created for
[RP](/seeds/roleplay) in the Elder Scrolls Online. She has a presence in a
few different settings but there are some things that are always the same about
her.

## Background

Gwen,

* grew up in the Alik'r Desert (Sentinel, specifically)
* has at least one sister, [Haruna](/original-character/haruna-taloet)
* is deeply religious and follows the Redguard Pantheon
