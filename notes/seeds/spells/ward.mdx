title: "Ward"

### Description

A translucent disk of materialized magicka forms in front of the character.
Spells which strike the disk are absorbed entirely. Every spell the ward
absorbs damages the ward until it breaks and needs to be recast. Physical
attacks are not effected in any way by this kind of magical ward.

Generally, when working with wards, I try to reason about the relative strength
of spells. A novice ward can probably block a single novice spell before
breaking. A master ward can probably block a single master spell before
breaking, but it could likely block many many novice spells.

Remember to consider the magicka cost of maintaining a ward. It would be
challenging even for a skilled mage to maintain both a ward and another spell.
Even when they *can* do both at once, it's unlikely they can maintain it for
long unless something is empowering them.

### Stats

**School:** Restoration

**Skill Level:**
 - Novice up to Master
   - casting with higher skill takes more magicka but causes the ward to be
     stronger
