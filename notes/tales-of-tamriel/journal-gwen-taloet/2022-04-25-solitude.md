We arrived in Solitude today - Malyani, Kireth, and myself. We left a
note for the others, hopefully they'll be able to find us here. Still,
I can hardly sleep for waiting on what's coming tomorrow. Telling the
Princess about Malyani and myself... It's enough to make even the
bravest of people nervous.

It's weird though, this is hardly the only thing on my mind anymore.
Every time I have a conversation with Kireth and Mal, I'm left with the
distinct impression that _something_ is off between them. Kireth
becomes quiet - well, quiet*er* - at the strangest of times. Is there
anything I can do? I cannot believe they've had a falling out, but still
I worry. It's a little absurd to worry about this, given what's happening
and what we're up against.

Speaking of which..

No.

Not today.

I'm not ready to write about what happened with the hagraven.
