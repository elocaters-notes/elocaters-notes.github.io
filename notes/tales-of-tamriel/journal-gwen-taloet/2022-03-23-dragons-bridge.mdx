I arrived in a town called "Dragon's Bridge" recently. I met a friendly group
of travelers, Martin and a quiet Dunmer who called herself only "Mal".

The day after meeting them, we met a woman in town pleading for help. We raced
to the north, only to find her home filled with *vampires*. I froze when I
found out.

I froze.

It was fortunate for the family that Martin, Israr, and Jas were there to drive
the vampires away. But even knowing that, I mourn for my friends - in attacking
the dead they are surely now cursed by the gods.

But what am I to do? I'm here to help, but how can I help when doing so will
surely push me away from the gods instead of towards them.

Tonight I will pray. I am here to help, but I cannot see how! Surely the gods
will show me a Way.
