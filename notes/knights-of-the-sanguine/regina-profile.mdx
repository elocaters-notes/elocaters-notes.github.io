This is the detailed profile for [Regina](/original-character/regina-vesperum-advenae)
in the [Knights of the Sanguine](/knights-of-the-sanguine/) setting.

## Backstory

Regina was born in Narsis, a small town in western Deshaan. Her family was a part of House Hlaalu, but she harbors almost no personal allegiance to the great house. Growing up, she had a close relationship with her grandfather, who told her stories of the old Imperial empire and his experiences in Cyrodiil before the war. So it came to pass that when her parents died of the plague, Regina left Deshaan behind to discover the world her grandfather had so lovingly described.

### The Legion

The empire had long since fallen when Regina found Cyrodiil. The Imperial City had long since been overrun by the Planemeld and the countryside ravaged by the Three Alliances squabbling for power. Nevertheless, inspired as she was by her grandfather's stories, Regina chose to remain in Cyrodiil. In staying, she found the Respoken Legion - the unofficial remnants of the 18th Legion of the fallen empire. With the Legion, Regina learned the fundamentals of coordinated warfare; she learned to be a soldier.

### A Notable Sword

Regina carries a sword with a ruddy brown blade. To the casual observer, it might appear to be a poorly-handled blade of iron or steel which had been allowed to rust. But the keen-eyed smith or enchanter might recognize the metal for what it is: meteoric iron. A blade forged from a fragment of Atherius. The metal is coveted by smiths and enchanters alike for its incredible strength and resistance to magical and mundane elements.

The detailed inlay on the blade grows warm when the sword contacts anything of Daedric origin. It eventually heats the entire blade - including the handle - to the point of burning on contact. Regina is reluctant to wield the sword for very long.
