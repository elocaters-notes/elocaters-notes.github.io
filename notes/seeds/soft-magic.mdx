Soft Magic systems generally have little to no guidance on what magic is
capable of or limited by. In my opinion, this is the correct way to categorize
magic in the Elder Scrolls universe. That might be surprising at first because
there are literal *game mechanics* for magic that players use, but I'm really
thinking about the *stories* rather than the game mechanics. As a story telling
tool, magic in the Elder Scrolls seems incredibly fluid and generally follows
whatever the quest-author decides is needed for the sake of their story.

That flexibility poses a problem: **how can we maintain stakes**.

Personally, I find the video below a nice exploration of how to write with
a soft magic system. The big idea is this:

One way to do this in a [roleplay](/seeds/roleplay) setting is to give mage
characters a list of spells. This can help you (the writer) to maintain a
consistent theme with the character, and it helps your collaborators understand
when a magical scene has tension.
