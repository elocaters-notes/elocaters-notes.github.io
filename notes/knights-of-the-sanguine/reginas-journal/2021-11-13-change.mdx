Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that make plants or children? Go deeper.

For the past weeks, my life has been a blur. I followed Sir Martin to that ruin with Fynres and Saegar; what happened inside was unnatural. When Sir Martin was injured, he changed in ways that frightened me - in ways that still frighten me.  And I had almost convinced myself he wasn't so different from a mortal. That maybe I wouldn't be so different either. Even so, I admire him - I can see how he cares for the rest of us.

He's accepted me as his Squire, and I couldn't be happier

Everything I knew has changed. <br />
Everything I currently know will change. <br />
Everything I have yet to know will change me. <br />

That I change for the better.
