Haruna is an [original character](/original-character/) I created for
[RP](/seeds/roleplay) in the Elder Scrolls Online. She has a presence in a few
different settings, but some things are always the same about her.

## Background

Haruna,

- grew up in the Alik'r Desert (Sentinel)
- has a half-sister [Gwen Taloet](/original-character/gwen-taloet)
- has a deep academic understanding of Redguard history and religion
- generally doesn't regard any religion with much reverence, even if she
  follows one herself
- has split heritage, part Redguard from her father's side and part Imperial
  from her mother's side of the family
