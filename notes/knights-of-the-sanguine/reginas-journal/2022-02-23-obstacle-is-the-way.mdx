    In a sense, people are our proper occupation.
    Our job is to do them good and put up with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us --
    like sun, wind, animals. They may impede our actions, but they cannot
    impede our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and
    adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to
    our acting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The impediment to action advances action. <br />
    What stands in the way becomes the way.

I never really understood these words. They sound like a contradiction. But he always was a staunch believer in the virtue of a rational mind, and the first principle of reason is that contradictions cannot exist.

Thinking back over the past few months of my life is a surreal experience. When I fell to that creature in the caverns beneath the Niben, I thought I'd finished a life well spent. When I found myself alive but corrupted, I thought there to be no way to live well. No way to live up to my proper occupation. Vampirism is the single greatest obstacle to following my convictions. But now, when I look around at the life I lead - the love I share with Martin and the power we wield against the Planemeld - I see something I could never have expected. The good we do is not despite our curse; it is empowered by it.

I can understand now what he meant by those words. There will always be something in the way, some obstacle or barrier which impedes progress. But my intention to live up to my proper occupation - to do good and put up with them - can never be stopped. Each piece of adversity, even when it's something that threatens all I hold dear, is an opportunity to live up to the Virtues. An opportunity to answer the question "Am I worthy?" with a resounding "yes" and find new heights in the process.

When the crush of opposition threatens to overwhelm, I will remember this mantra:

"The obstacle is the way. That which stands in the way is the way."
