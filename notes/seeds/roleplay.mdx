Roleplay (RP) is the process of collaborative writing with friends. People
typically use [original characters (OCs)](/original-character/) but the
setting is typically something already established.

RP differs from other forms of creative writing in that each character
typically has a unique author. This gives RP a certain unpredictability that
can be really fun to explore.
